Program 'bmpreduce'  takes from the command line the name  <filename>.bmp of a 24-bit uncompressed RGB .bmp file of any size 
and a 'reduction factor' between 0.0 and 1.0,  then creates a reduced image using 'bilineal interpolation' as described in the second
reference and saves  the reduced image as <filename>reduced.bmp .
